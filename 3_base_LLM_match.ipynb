Signature End your cover letter with your signature, handwritten, followed by your typed name.  If this is an email, simply include your typed name, followed by your contact information.  When you are writing letters, it\\'s important to select a font that is clear and easy to read.  Here\\'s how to choose a letter font that is professional and readable, as well as how to choose the appropriate font size for your letter.  It is important to select a font that is large enough so that the reader doesn\\'t have to squint to read your letter, but not so big that your letter doesn\\'t fit well on a page.  Use a Basic Font Using a simple font will ensure that your letter is easy to read.  Basic fonts like Arial, Verdana, and Times New Roman work well.  Depending on how much content you have in your letter select a 10 or 12 point font size.  It\\'s best if you can format your letter so it fits on one page.  Regardless of the font size you select, there needs to be space at the top of the letter and between each paragraph and each section of your cover letter.  Here\\'s how to space your cover letter.  When you are using Microsoft Word, here is how to select a font for your letter and how to select the font size.  If you\\'re using a different word processing program, the process is similar.  Select the content of your cover letter then choose a font and a font size.  You may need to try a couple of different sizes to make sure that your cover letter fits on a single page.  How to Select a Cover Letter Font Select a font from the list at the top of your document before you start writing your letter, or: Type your cover letter.  Highlight the content of your letter.  Either select the font from the pop-up window or select the font from the list at the top of the document.        Experience      Production Associate   03/2006   to   Current     Company Name   City  ,   State       cover letter typically accompanies each resume you send out.  Your cover letter may make the difference between obtaining a job interview or having your resume ignored, so it makes good sense to devote the necessary time and effort to writing effective cover letters.  A cover letter should complement, not duplicate, your resume.  Its purpose is to interpret the data-oriented, factual resume and add a personal touch.  A cover letter is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a critical first impression.  Find out more of the differences between a resume and a cover letter.  There are three general types of cover letters: The application letter which responds to a known job opening (review samples) The prospecting letter which inquires about possible positions (review samples) The networking letter which requests information and assistance in your job search (review samples) Your cover letter should be designed specifically for each purpose outlined above as well as for each position you seek.  Do not design a form letter and send it to every potential employer (you know what you do with junk mail!).  Effective cover letters explain the reasons for your interest in the specific organization and identify your most relevant skills or experiences (remember, relevance is determined by the employer\\'s self-interest).  The letter should express a high level of interest and knowledge about the position.  Keep in mind that your cover letter doesn\\'t need to be long - a page is plenty.  Here\\'s information on how long a cover letter should be.

Copyright © 1999 - 2016. CyberCoders, Inc. All rights reserved.\\n\\nCANDIDATE RESUME:\\n         INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ANALYST       Summary    To pursue a caring and creative career, where I can apply my existing knowledge, acquire new skills and contribute effectively to this nation\\'s future, our children.\\nHaving prior experience in IT field, exploring the field to be with children lead to do the Early Childhood Education course and be the part of the little bud\\'s life.      Skills    apple, Art, book, Oral, concept, conflict resolution, CPR, creativity, Designing, direction, Documentation, First Aid, Flash, fundraising, drawing, instruction, Materials, meetings, organizing, philosophy, express, Read, Recording, Safety, sound, teacher, Teaching, Transportation        Experience     09/2010   to   09/2011     Information Technology Analyst    Company Name          I believe that each child has their own potential and interests and curiosity in learning.  Designing an organized classroom setup, positive and welcoming, caring and secured, safe-risk taking, theme based, and discussions on their interests during class meetings would create warm atmosphere and environment to grow in every domain of development socially, emotionally, physically, and intellectually.  I believe the teacher needs to be a supportive person as well as a guide in providing the information, and plans for hands on activities with tools and materials that help them for self-discovery and understand the lesson in curriculum.  Letting kids be kids and have freedom to express their own thoughts and creativity and valuing them.  My personal goal for my future classroom is to grow their potential and interests in their own pace without pressurizing with targets.  Students should be given information on where to find the answers and given the opportunity to explore the solution rather than giving the direct answers, this gives the space for exploration and creativity.  I would have the strong idea on having the curriculum inclusive of each child\\'s needs and interests.  Curriculum plan involving group work, which is the key for the student led jobs, and direction to help others, teach respect for others and themselves.  Motivation and stimulation are the factors that pull out the full potential of the child.  Recording their interests and motivated ideas of every student periodically, and sharing with the parents and caregivers to engage the children.  Giving the base line of the activity and watching them on how they expand and give new dimension for more than we thought which is a great feeling.  Giving the ownership to the children yields mutual trust, support, and love between teacher and child.  Developing trust, love and respect for themselves and others help avoid bullying and hurtful words/actions.  Make the point that, every child should be treated consistent, equal, fair and approachable.  Giving them the time and space to explore along with spending valuable time with them promotes the emotional development as they spend more time in school than any other place.  I believe in the quote \\'A strong body makes the mind strong and strong mind makes a body strong\\', I would encourage more of the outdoor activities during the supporting weather.  I feel interaction among peers, conflict resolution, turn taking, creativity, helping others, teaching love and respect can be achieved more in outdoor group activities.  A healthy meal plan are one main criteria in making sure they have a balanced diet every meal they eat, lots of fruits and vegetables, dairy foods, and less sodium and sugar.  I would be compassionate, dedicated, and continue learn and strive to give the best part to my children as a future teacher.  I understand teaching involves regulations, restrictions, and responsibilities, as with any other job but this comes with the package of cherishing moments, excitement, joy of being with the innocent and laughing children.  Enjoy students and everything they do and accept them as they are, that would be the best gift we give the children who come to school leaving the parents.  My philosophy may grow in the future with experience and continued learning and welcoming the ideas and knowledge from work place.         01/2010   to   08/2010     Technology Analyst    Company Name               10/2006   to   06/2008     Software Engineer    Company Name               07/2004   to   10/2006     Project Engineer    Company Name          I am attaching hereby the Conduct Certificate and Experience Certificate from previous organization.

This in of itself, speaks to the trust and value I provide the organization.  I was hired to design, and deploy the first data center the company owned in its efforts to deploy a new offering, an enterprise Software as a Service (SaaS) product.  I was initially an employee of an Adsystech customer working with the Adsystech EVP on an enterprise County Wide project and posed the idea that they should move from \"selling\" software to \"renting\" it via an up and coming model SaaS.  Today, everyone is using SaaS products and paying monthly for various products but in 2004 (when I initially made the proposal) it was an exciting and new potential market which I leveraged to increase the returns at Adsystech and most importantly, generate new recurring revenue.  I was hired in 05\\' to put in place all things SaaS, this included designing a data center from the ground up, creating cyber security policies and controls, putting together a team to support the data center as well as a team to provide technical support for the new product offering.  As an early adopter, in 2008 I designed and deployed a hybrid cloud environment in our data center.  Again in 08\\' this was a new technology but my decision demonstrates foresight in emerging technologies and understand in the value of leveraging technology to become more efficient and financial prudent.

After promotion I continued to server as the project manager for the 2.5 million dollar system rollout which ranged from gathering the business requirements for the design and deployment to creating the processes and managing the team to for the roll out to ~2000 users across Los Angeles County.  In this capacity I managed a project support team including administrators, help desk staff and trainers.  As the IT Manager, I supervised network administrators and was responsible for all high level network design and architecture for the organization.  I evaluated the security risks, ensuring HITECH/HIPAA protocol were followed.

I was a visionary in regards to technical business operations, responsible for providing professional staff at various locations with efficient, up-to-date, secure and stable voice and data communications on a daily basis within budget.  The ability to use good judgment, proven technologies and industry standards to balance ease of use with security.  I am a fast paced leader with the patience to oversee the maintenance of existing systems while at the same time plan the implementation of new technologies in a cost efficient and timely manner.  I am both a professional team leader and player that has directly managed a staff of seven information technical professionals as well as participating in many project implementation teams and initiatives.  I am experienced in many of the technical methods, tools and applications used in business operations with the ability to connect multiple offices with highly secure and redundant Internet connections.  While at the firm I was able to receive better than competitive pricing for the circuits due to the quantity of services required as well as my vendor negotiation skills.  I have the technical knowledge and experience required for the strategic planning and funding of annual and multi-year business operations.  My efforts have resulted in a direct costs savings in business operations.  Most recently, we implemented user provided smart phones and free apps to provide efficient digital dictation and provided mobile capability to access our document management system.  I have a dedicated work ethic that is required to oversee day-to-day technical business operations updating and upgrading systems in use while at the same time implementing new systems: Upgraded the firms bread-n-butter time and billing financial system several times.  Upgraded the Word Perfect Application Suite to the Microsoft Office 2000 Suite.  Upgraded Microsoft Office 2000 Suite to the Microsoft Office 2007 Suite.  Upgraded the GroupWise Messaging to Outlook Messaging.  Upgraded the Worldox document management system to Worldox GX3.  Upgraded the Audix voice messaging to Mutare voice messaging.  Assisted the Marketing department to implement a firm wide Client Relationship Management (CRM) system.  Setup up Voice Over Internet Protocols (VOIP) systems at two regional offices.  Implemented and upgraded many of100 technical applications and systems used at the firm on an as needed basis to improve efficiency.  Implemented several mobile applications on attorney personal devices to improve efficiency (VPN connectivity, RDP clients, Dictate digital dictation, Dropbox, Microsoft Office Mobile Suite of applications, Linkedin, Business Card Scanner, Twitter, etc.) The firm experienced minimum unplanned system downtime under my watch and my team and I oversaw and provided training on the many various applications, processes and procedures used in business operations.  I am an experienced data security officer with the skills and knowledge to ensure data is adequately protected.  I was the firm\\'s Security Officer and developed the technical security systems and procedures used in business operations.  It was an interesting responsibility due to the challenges with balancing \"ease of use\" while ensuring system and data \"security.\" Every year my team and I would oversee a mandatory HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) Program Review.  Every other year my team and I would facilitate a system wide vulnerability audit that included social engineering and vulnerability testing techniques.  I am an experienced project manager with the skill set, knowledge and interpersonal tools required to ensure the timely and efficient implementation of systems and applications.  I enjoy the aspects of project management as it involves \"cradle to grave\" involvement.  Interacting with the users to determine their technical and budget needs, interacting with vendors, communicating with my peers and self-study to find the right technology to meet the need, testing the application and processes or feasibility and efficiency, documenting the processes and procures involved, preparing user instructions and finally implementing and training users on the new system.  I appreciate the resources, processes and procedures required to ensure system efficiency and readiness.  At the firm most applications are hosted at the central office with the regional offices connecting with redundant Ethernet connections, this saves on the cost of having data centers and support staff at each firm location.  My team and I have also authored the firm\\'s business/continuity/disaster recovery plan for IT applications and systems.  The firm decided the priority and timeliness of systems and applications to recover.  I and my team have configured many IT systems to fail over to the backup systems automatically which is barely noticeable to users.

When marketing doesn\\'t\\nfeel like marketing, and people organically connect to your message, you\\'ve birthed a movement.

Similarly, business entities cannot survive the current\\nglobalized, hyper-competitive market through, what I call, \"Corporate -Isolationism\".  A business, whether a\\nstart-up or an established titan of industry, must always find relevant ways connect and communicate with\\nits audience.  My interest in business started when my friend\\'s step-father told me \"The only road to success is the one\\nyou build through work and creativity\".  This statement has birthed a passion and drive to not only understand\\nhuman behavior in what motivates one to buy, but also the mechanics behind product positioning.  What about\\nthe product makes it appealing.  How can a business increase delivery efficiency.  How does a business drive\\nup profit margins while driving down production costs?\\nIn conclusion, between my experience in accounting, marketing research, marketing strategy, product\\npositioning, market communication, and public relations has led me to believe two key things.  First, individual\\'s\\ndesire to buy hinges on the appealing presentation.  It has to be palatable to all five senses within 30 seconds\\nor less.  Second, the product must serve a customer\\'s need longer than the next fade of products.  In other\\nwords, the product must withstand a competitor\\'s product in offering versatile utility and adaptability options\\nto every customer.  It is my hope that my communication skills along with my experience in marketing, sales, and accounting will\\nassist in your company\\'s profitability in product positioning.
