80527194,"         LEASING CONSULTANT       Summary    Microsoft Office (4 years), Sales (4 years), Quickbooks (4 years), Performance Management (2 years),
Accounting (4 years), Market Research (4 years), Marketing Strategy (4 years), Marketing Communications
(4 years), Financial Analysis (4 years), Public Relations (4 years)        Accomplishments      To Whom It May Concern,
My name is Vincent Hall, and I hate the ""One-Size-Fits-All"" approach to business.  When marketing doesn't
feel like marketing, and people organically connect to your message, you've birthed a movement.  Gone are the days of the 1950's where individualism rooted in autonomy allowed one to be labeled as the ""lone
wolf"" and heroically conquer the ""Corporate Ladder"".  Similarly, business entities cannot survive the current
globalized, hyper-competitive market through, what I call, ""Corporate -Isolationism"".  A business, whether a
start-up or an established titan of industry, must always find relevant ways connect and communicate with
its audience.  My interest in business started when my friend's step-father told me ""The only road to success is the one
you build through work and creativity"".  This statement has birthed a passion and drive to not only understand
human behavior in what motivates one to buy, but also the mechanics behind product positioning.  What about
the product makes it appealing.  How can a business increase delivery efficiency.  How does a business drive
up profit margins while driving down production costs?
In conclusion, between my experience in accounting, marketing research, marketing strategy, product
positioning, market communication, and public relations has led me to believe two key things.  First, individual's
desire to buy hinges on the appealing presentation.  It has to be palatable to all five senses within 30 seconds
or less.  Second, the product must serve a customer's need longer than the next fade of products.  In other
words, the product must withstand a competitor's product in offering versatile utility and adaptability options
to every customer.  It is my hope that my communication skills along with my experience in marketing, sales, and accounting will
assist in your company's profitability in product positioning.

My name is Vincent Hall, and I hate the ""One-Size-Fits-All"" approach to business.</li> <li> When marketing doesn't
feel like marketing, and people organically connect to your message, you've birthed a movement.</li> <li> Gone are the days of the 1950's where individualism rooted in autonomy allowed one to be labeled as the ""lone
wolf"" and heroically conquer the ""Corporate Ladder"".</li> <li> Similarly, business entities cannot survive the current
globalized, hyper-competitive market through, what I call, ""Corporate -Isolationism"".</li> <li> A business, whether a
start-up or an established titan of industry, must always find relevant ways connect and communicate with
its audience.</li> <li> My interest in business started when my friend's step-father told me ""The only road to success is the one
you build through work and creativity"".</li> <li> This statement has birthed a passion and drive to not only understand
human behavior in what motivates one to buy, but also the mechanics behind product positioning.</li> <li> What about
the product makes it appealing.</li> <li> How can a business increase delivery efficiency.</li> <li> How does a business drive
up profit margins while driving down production costs?
In conclusion, between my experience in accounting, marketing research, marketing strategy, product
positioning, market communication, and public relations has led me to believe two key things.</li> <li> First, individual's
desire to buy hinges on the appealing presentation.</li> <li> It has to be palatable to all five senses within 30 seconds
or less.</li> <li> Second, the product must serve a customer's need longer than the next fade of products.</li> <li> In other
words, the product must withstand a competitor's product in offering versatile utility and adaptability options
to every customer.</li> <li> It is my hope that my communication skills along with my experience in marketing, sales, and accounting will
assist in your company's profitability in product positioning.</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""section"" id=""SECTION_EXPR937509800"" style=""padding-top:0px;""> <div class=""heading""> <div class=""sectiontitle"" id=""SECTNAME_EXPR937509800""> Experience</div> </div> <div class=""paragraph firstparagraph"" id=""PARAGRAPH_937509800_1_616901289"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""https://schema.org/Organization"" style=""padding-top:0px;""> <span class=""dates_wrapper""> <span class=""jobdates"" format=""%m/%Y"" id=""937509800JSTD1""> 05/2016</span> <span>  to </span> <span class=""jobdates"" format=""%m/%Y"" id=""937509800EDDT1""> Current</span> </span> <div class=""singlecolumn""> <span class=""paddedline""> <span class=""jobtitle"" id=""937509800JTIT1""> Leasing Consultant</span> </span> <span class=""paddedline"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""https://schema.org/postalAddress""> <span class=""companyname"" id=""937509800COMP1"" itemprop=""name""> Company Name</span> <span>  － </span> <span class=""joblocation jobcity"" id=""937509800JCIT1"" itemprop=""addressLocality""> City</span> <span> , </span> <span class=""joblocation jobstate"" id=""937509800JSTA1"" itemprop=""addressRegion""> State</span> </span> <span class=""paddedline""> <span class=""jobline"" id=""937509800JDES1"" itemprop=""description""> <ul> <li> Greet, assist, and screen prospective clients by collecting demographic information via questionnaire.</li> <li> Actively listening to concerns of prospective clients in order to offer consultations in regards to product value,

My responsibilities were to assist public electronic filing programmers by analyzing, diagnosing and making proposals on error in software to getting there software to passing the IRS standards for electronic filing.  I did this by using IRS IRM and thereby have them transmit standard test returns then I would have to print out there transmitted test returns and analyses and determine where there programming error's  were and call them and  communicate to them where the error occurred.  They would make the correction and it would be accepted as an Electronic Filing Software Program.  I also work closely with the electronic filing Tax Examiners in assisting the transmitters in problem solving their situation.  Another responsibility I had was to have all of the data copied to a nine-track tape and processed on the mainframe computer from that output then we had to drain the information on to an archival system that allowed the authorized I.R.S  employees to access the returns if a taxpayer had questions about their returns.  I also helped my group to maintain our network and desktop computers.  There were times we would lose connection to the network and we would have to use a network sniffer that would assist us on the type and location of the problem that needed to be fixed.  I also would install updates to the workstations, as they became available to us thru download transmittal.  Job Related Training:.  Item	Item Description	         Completion Date.
