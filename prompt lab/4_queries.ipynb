    "Our first task is to work on our automation agent. It requires objective criteria to evaluate CVs on. We need to make a list of criteria it should generally keep track of. For example, the necessary skills employees need to be able to perform in the job. Trainable skills that can be learned or developer. Additional skills which might be helpful. Personal attributes and values (often times soft skills). Consider what kinds of criteria are relevant when evaluating a candidate and give me a list. If relevant for the job. Once the criteria for educational qualifications (and any certifications) are met, you could start by checking whether the degree was obtained in the usual time frame (maybe 2 or 3 years). Note delays or extensions in the completion of a course.  Also red flags like job hopping, stagnant jobs and roles, excessive mistakes in the resume, too generic. "
